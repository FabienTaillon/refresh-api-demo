# RefreshView API
* Create a Scratch Org
* Push Metadata
* Assign the Refresh_API Permission Set
* Open the Org
* Create an Account

or run the [setupScratchOrg.sh](./setupScratchOrg.sh) script

Then there is a `RefreshView API Demo` component on the Account record page you can play with.    
Note that `force:refreshView` only works with Lightning Web Security disabled, whereas `RefreshView API` only works with Lightning Web Security enabled, so you'll have to switch that under Session Settings to play either with one or the other.
